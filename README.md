1. Create a Spring Boot Project to practice the following annotations
- @Controller - since we're practice @Controller, you need to include thymeleaf template engine, just define a page like in the class, return the page name. There's no need to understand the syntax to display model attributes, etc. We're going to build RESTful application in the future.
- @RequestMapping
- @GetMapping
- @RequestParam
- @PathVariable
2. Reading
- Servlet
- Spring MVC DispatcherServlet
